# Simple Search

Forget the clutter of Google, return to the basics.

This project is a simple "search engine" that uses Python to search Wikipedia, Reddit and nothing else. It uses Tkinter to display the results which automatically open in whichever browser is your PC's default.

Simply run the included .exe (compiled with pyInstaller), type your query, and check out the search results.
